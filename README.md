# fractal-clock

This is a fork of interesting opengl project previosly shared by https://github.com/toroidal-code/, but with:
```
- coloring:                  becouse i like it
- MSVS2012 compatibility:    becouse i don't have modern pc
- resotored settings window: becouse it should be useful (to be completed soon)
```
The purpose is to let user have all possible settings to playing with this amazing clock.
